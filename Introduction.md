Hello, I'm Leonardo Taehwan Kim.
I'm a software engineer in Seoul, South Korea with five years of experience developing both iOS and Android mobile applications.

I also have experience developing server backends, designing database structures, and implementing responsive websites.

Usually, I design or assist in designing user experiences for the applications I develop, including storyboards, application layouts, corporate identity, and more.

Although it didn't work out as I originally planned, I also have experience in founding and running my own business.

One of my applications, called "Music Off", a music timer for Android, as of now has over 3.5 million downloads on the Google Play Store.

I've created many open source libraries and open sourced many of my projects, all of which are available on Github.

Currently, my English skill is about business level and improving all the time.
I'm currently looking for a software engineering position in US.


 with a company which can support me with an H-1B or other immigration visa.
