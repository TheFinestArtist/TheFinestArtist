Hello, I'm Leonardo Taehwan Kim.

I am an Artist who loves to make new products. I am capable of designing user experiences, developing Android and iOS applications, developing backend server, developing homepage, designing database structures, marketing through various channels such as Facebook, Instagram and influential blogs, optimizing business model, developing business.

Even though I value design, development, marketing and business equally, I tend to take software development more enthusiastically. Therefore, I am under the impression as a software engineer, more specifically a mobile application developer.

I named myself as Leonardo, which has meaning of Lion, Da Vinci and DiCaprio. You probably noticed that my logo resembles a lion. The logo is made of three letters: T,F and A which stands for "The Finest Artist", which is my slogan.

Hello, I'm Leonardo Taehwan Kim.

I am an Artist who loves to make new products. And I do have lots of experiences in developing products: I am capable of designing user experiences, developing Android and iOS applications, developing backend server, developing homepage, designing database structures, marketing through various channels such as Facebook, Instagram and influential blogs, optimizing business model, developing business.

Even though I values design, development, marketing and business equally, my skill is little biased towards software development. Therefore, many people think that I'm just a software engineer, usually a mobile application developer.

Hello, I'm Leonardo Taehwan Kim.

I named Leonardo after Lion, Da Vinci and DiCaprio: I liked to be a team leader, an artist and famous.

You probably noticed that my logo (up there ⇡⇡⇡) looks just like a lion. But, did you know that it is made of three letters: T,F,A which stands for "The Finest Artist"?

I am an artist who values design, development, marketing and business equally. I mean those are the key features to develop a product and I've tried my best to learn and cover them all.

I have 5 years of mobile application development experience in Android and iOS and 3 years in backend server development. Building a homepage is no questionable but not yet with front end development.

Most of mobile and web application's user experience design is done by myself but not the user interface and graphic design. I can use Pixelmator to do some simple editing. With the knowledge of development, I can design user experience more appropriately.
