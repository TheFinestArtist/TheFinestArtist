Hello, I'm Leonardo Taehwan Kim.

I named Leonardo after Lion, Da Vinci and DiCaprio: I liked to be a team leader, an artist and famous.

I'm pretty sure that you found my logo (up there ⇡⇡⇡) looks like a Lion. But, did you know that it is made of three letters: T,F,A which stands for "The Finest Artist"?

I am an Artist who values equally among design, development, marketing and business. I mean those are the key features to develop a product and I tried my best to learn and cover them all.

I have 5 years of mobile application development experience in Android and iOS and 3 years in backend server development. Building a homepage is no questionable but not yet with front end development.

Most of mobile and web application's user experience design is done by myself but not the user interface and graphic design. I can use Pixelmator to do some simple editing. With the knowledge of development, I can design user experience more appropriately.
