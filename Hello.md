Hello, I'm Leonardo Taehwan Kim.

I'm a software engineer with five years of mobile application development experience in both Android and iOS using Java and Objective-C.

I also have experiences of developing backend server, designing database structures and developing responsive websites.

I usually design user experiences for the applications I develop, including creating storyboards, wireframing, designing application layouts, designing corporate identity, and more.

I also have an experience in founding a company in the past as a CEO.

One of my applications, called "Music Off", a music timer for Android, has over 3.5 million downloads on the Google Play Store so far.

I created many open source libraries and open sourced many of my projects, all of which are available on Github.

I'm currently looking for a software engineering position.
