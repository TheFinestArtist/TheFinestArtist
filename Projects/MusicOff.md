- Music Off is developed into both Android and iOS applications, which help people to turn their musics off while they are sleeping. Simply, it is a timer for music with automatic sleep checking algorithm. I designed user experience and developed Android and iOS applications for Music Off.

#### How did I get started?
It was freezing. I could hardly go outside. I've never experienced cold winter before. It was 2010 and everything started from there. All of a sudden, I came across with this simple thought that I should learn to code. I could surely code in many languages such as C or JAVA, but I wanted to code real things not like some random projects from courses I took at school. So I decided to attend a private institution and learn how to make iOS applications. There was a conflict with my schedule and so, I learned how to code for Android instead. There were two course for Android. One was for beginners and the other for experts. Each course lasted for one month. While I was taking these courses, I had this little idea to make a timer application that can turn off music before I go to sleep. I had many more ideas but I chose the simplest one that I handle. I made my first draft of the features and I wanted to add some more. I wanted a proper design, user experience, and some more cool features. So I asked my dad for money support and to hire a designer for me. As I can remember, he invested $400 into my project, which was a lot for me at that time. It was almost a month of my living expenses. Moreover, he supported me to attend the private institution. It cost about $500 per month altogether. Everything was new for me. I didn't know how to find a designer, good user experience and the exact meaning behind a user. At that time, there was no guidelines for designing Android applications. After I searched endlessly through Naver and Google for a designer, I found an interesting blog and send an email about building an Android application together. Luckily, she said yes.

All of a sudden, I came across with this simple thought, I should learn some coding. I mean I could surely code in many languages such as C or JAVA. I started coding from high school, by the way. But I want to code real stuff not like some random projects from courses I took from the school. So I decided to attend private institute and learn how to make an iOS applications. There was problem with schedule and I learned Android instead. There was two course for Android. One for beginner and another for experts. Each course for one month.

I didn't know how to find a designer, what is good user experience and what is user actually. At that time, there was no guideline for designing Android applications. I searched Naver, Korean Google, keyword with designer. I found a interesting blog and send an email about building an Android application together. Luckily, she said yes.
