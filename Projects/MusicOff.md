- Music Off is developed into both Android and iOS applications, which help people to turn their musics off while they are sleeping. Simply, it is a timer for music with automatic sleep checking algorithm. I designed user experience and developed Android and iOS applications for Music Off.

### **How did I get started?**
It was freezing. I could hardly go outside. I've never experienced cold winter before. It was 2010 and everything started from there. All of a sudden, I came across with this simple thought that I should learn to code. I could surely code in many languages such as C or JAVA, but I wanted to code real things not like some random projects from courses I took at school. So I decided to attend a private institution and learn how to make iOS applications. There was a conflict with my schedule and so, I learned how to code for Android instead. There were two course for Android. One was for beginners and the other for experts. Each course lasted for one month. While I was taking these courses, I had this little idea to make a timer application that can turn off music before I go to sleep. I had many more ideas but I chose the simplest one that I handle. I made my first draft of the features and I wanted to add some more. I wanted a proper design, user experience, and some more cool features. So I asked my dad for money support and to hire a designer for me. As I can remember, he invested $400 into my project, which was a lot for me at that time. It was almost a month of my living expenses. Moreover, he supported me to attend the private institution. It cost about $500 per month altogether. Everything was new for me. I didn't know how to find a designer, good user experience and the exact meaning behind a user. At that time, there was no guidelines for designing Android applications. After I searched endlessly through Naver and Google for a designer, I found an interesting blog and send an email about building an Android application together. Luckily, she was positive about the suggestion.

### **My contribution**
I've been participated this project as an owner, Android app developer, iOS app developer, user experience designer and marketer.  

#### Development  
100% of Android and 90% of iOS app had been implemented by me.

I designed all of the user experience. Usually I sketch them on [<u>UX sketchbook</u>](http://www.uistencils.com/collections/sketch-pads/products/iphone-sketch-pad).

#### Marketing  
La and I conducted marketing in various ways. We posted blog about the app in English, Korean and Japanese. We reached some influential blogger and asked them to write a blogpost about the app. I paid little money for each post. We reached influential website which introduce new release apps in Japan. Some of them made cartoon about Music Off. Matthew and I conducted SNS marketing. We made Facebook Page. I spent some money for advertisement. We made some post about recommended music before you get to sleep. I participated all of the marketing because I was the only one who understand the app and user 100%.
