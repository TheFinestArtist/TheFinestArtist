- BTTENDANCE is a smart teaching assistant service. It provides 3 main features: automatic attendance checking, audience response and delicate notification system. I developed back-end server, Android application, iOS application and homepage and designed user experience for BTTENDANCE.

#### How did I get started?
Sanghoon and I first met at Computer Organization course as teammate. He had many brilliant ideas including attendance checking system using Bluetooth, which I was extremely interested in. He and I made a promise to develop this technology one day. And my moving to near his studio triggered this project to get started. We found two more founder Taekwon and Heehwan. Taekwon helped us with design and Heehwan helped us with marketing and business plans. We launched first version of BTTENDANCE, and thankfully two professor of our university used our first app.

#### Trash
I was taking some boring course called Computer Organization. Actually, the course itself was fine. The professor was extremely good at English: He has degree or MS and PhD in Stanford. Maybe these building up new product things are so fun for me, other stuff like taking course, meeting friends, playing games are not fun for me anymore. Anyway, I was waiting a guy named Sanghoon, who is my partner for team project of Computer Organization for entire semester. He showed up almost 2 hour later than the time we were supposed to meet. I was definitely mad at him, but I tried to keep my composure: We just met and didn't want to go harsh with team member at first. While we were solving the first project, I found he was actually my senior at hight school and we were at the same mathematics academy when we were middle school students. Haha...what a life... The most interesting things I found from him was he has lots of business ideas. And one of them was BTTENDANCE.  
My dormitory roommate lived outside almost all of the days. I used entire room, which were for 2 students and my friends from outside KAIST asked me to use my room for a day or two because one of the bed is empty anyway. I found that there is some demands for guest house since almost all of the KAIST students are from whole country and if the friends of KAIST students want to visit, they definitely needs some place to stay. I need some testing about this. So I uploaded my dormitory room at Airbnb for $10/day. I was planning to check how many calls I get from it and cancel the booking later on. I don't know how, guessing the Airbnb sent the email, the school knew that I posted my dormitory on Airbnb in like 12 hours. The first call I got by posting my dormitory was I'm at a crisis of expulsion. Arrgggggg...I met Sanghoon and discussed about this situation. His advise was to meet the professor who is in the charge of me, which makes me another problem because I just got back to school from the military service and the professor in charge of me had been changed while I was working for military service. Which means I never met her before. Awesome! I had no choice but to meet someone I never met before and tell her that you are in the charge of me, I made a big problem here and please help me. And this is what happened. Firstly, she laughed at me. Secondly, she twitted about this. And kindly she helped me out from expulsion. Anyway I lost rest of the interests in KAIST, kicked out from dormitory, moved near Sanghoon's studio and started building up BTTENDANCE.
