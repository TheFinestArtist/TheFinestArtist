## Vingle

#### Excerpt
- 2015/10/02
- Android
- Vingle is an interest based social network service and it has similar features to those of Pinterest, which allow you to signup, to fetch feeds, to like or save the posts. Chansuk and I developed the Android application for Vingle from the back-end by handling network to the front-end by implementing customized graphic user interface.

#### How did I get started
During my military service in Korea, I had time to build my own apps. As a result, I launched two apps called “Music Off” and “MusiCon.” However, after I came back from my military service, I had no time to build my own app since I had to work at home.School works got boring so I wrote "I want to do something creative and different" on the Facebook. Taehoon, the CEO of Watcha, one of the most popular startups in Korea, saw my post on the Facebook and asked me to have a dinner with him. He suggested me to submit a resume for his company. After I came back from the dinner I submitted my resume to the other startup company called Vingle because the company looks a bit more professional and the CEO and COO already had experience in building up successful startup called Viki. Vingle accepted my resume so I started working for them right after Christmas.  
I think I'm kind of person who wants to decide my life for myself. I felt really sorry for Taehoon after.

#### Trash
I returned to school after finishing my military duty. During the military service, I made two apps. One is called Music Off, which is successfully launched. And another is called MusiCon, which I failed to launch and decided to stop the project even though it was 95% done. After the midterm, I found school is so boring and I wrote "I want to do startup stuff." on the Facebook. Taehoon who is high senior of mine and also the CEO of Watcha, one of the most popular startup in Korea, saw my post on the Facebook. He called me and made an appointment for dinner that day. He drove from Seoul to Daejun for 90 minutes and we had a dinner and beer. He somehow persuaded me to apply a resume for his company and we mailed my resume to his company in my dormitory.  
After some hour, I thought like I should probably try to find some other startups, too. So I did and found Vingle, which looks a bit more professional and the CEO and COO already had experience in building up successful startup called Viki. I sent my resume to Vingle by myself this time. I started working for Vingle right after Christmas.  
I think I'm kind of person who want to decide my life by myself. I feel really sorry for Taehoon. So sorry T.T
