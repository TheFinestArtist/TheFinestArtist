## InstaStckr

#### Excerpt
- 2015/10/06
- PM, Android, Homepage, Marketing
- InstaStckr is a photo sticker application like Giddy Sticker or Giddyology. It lets you say more about your photo with special emojis and customizable sticker. I develop Android application and homepage for InstaStckr. Also, I'm in the charge of marketing of the project.

#### Story
It was weekend, maybe Saturday as I remember. I was trying to find an engineer who can help me developing App called Globee and Min was wrapping up designing my logo by cutting the image and extracting the name card illustrator file. We were concentrating at what we are doing, suddenly Min told me that she want to make an app and it is very simple. She said she found many people, usually girls I guess, uses iPhone's copy & paste pop-up to hide some part of their photo, which is not wanted to be shared but at the same time they want to share the photo itself. So, her idea was simply make customizable copy & paste pop-up for user. At that time, I was planning to make other app called Sleeping Good :), which helps people who has trouble with insomnia. Anyway, I looked up whether there is any other app similar with her idea, and I found one called Sense Sticker. But the user's comments and interest about the app was not bad and since the idea looked really simple... I said "Yes, I will finish making this app in <strike>3 days</strike>". It turns out it needs <u>3 months</u>..haha :D

## Globee

#### Excerpt
- 2015/10/05
- PM, Server, Android, iOS, UX Design
- Globee is a native tutor matching service, which has similar user interface to that of Tinder. I carefully re-designed user experience of the application from the first draft of wireframe, designed database model and developed server. Chanil and I developed the Android and iOS applications for Globee.

#### Story
I've been Boston to participate a program called KIC Start Mass Challenge Program. There were over 20 startups who want to apply a worldwide startup accelerator, Mass Challenge. We were taking accelerating course for 3 weeks in Boston University Questrom School of Business. This course helped us to learn how to make a pitch, how to build up our business, successful business story and etc. For 3 weeks, we were staying at the same hotel, taking the same courses and hanging around together and we get to know each other very well. After we graduate this course and go back to Korea, Junghak who is CEO of Zumanji said he really need me to help him to build up service called Globee and he really looked desperate. I couldn't say No. Anyway the concept looked nice to me and he said he just need prototype so that he can show the app to New York investors. Turns out his team was expecting very nice and high quality app. What a liaaaaar..ha..

## Bread

#### Excerpt
- 2015/10/04
- Android, UX Design
- Bread is a bookshelf app for you. It helps you to save books for later use or leave comments about the books. I re-designed user experience of Bread iOS application like the that of Android, which follows Google material design guideline. And I also developed Android application for Bread.

#### Story
It was over 2AM in the morning. I was coding BTTENDANCE iOS app overnight. There were 3 more people who were working in the 24 hour cafe. Somehow I got lost my concentration, and I opened up Facebook to see what other people were doing. There was a KAIST computer science group and I requested friendship to someone who I found interesting including Chanil. He accepted me so quick, sent me a message and I was surprised that he was not sleeping too. Several month later I got message from Chanil, he said he wanted to meet me and talk about startups and life. And I said yes.  
We were having a talk in cafe and found out we both applied for same government supporting program. And that day was the announcing day for the 1st candidate of the program. Result was like I made it and he didn't. It felt awkward. Anyway, I found government support is not that helpful because they requested too  many documents and also there were too many restriction and limits. So I dropped out from the programs. Chanil passed other supporting program later on.  
Since I was building business without any money support and Chanil has one. I needed some money and Chanil needed someone who can make his iOS application into Android version, so I said I will help him. Maybe I might find some interest in reading books while making a bookshelf application :)
