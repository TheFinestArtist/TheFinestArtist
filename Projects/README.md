## InstaStckr

#### Excerpt
- 2015/10/06
- PM, Android, Homepage, Marketing
- InstaStckr is a photo sticker application like Giddy Sticker or Giddyology. It lets you say more about your photo with special emojis and customizable sticker. I develop Android application and homepage for InstaStckr. Also, I'm in the charge of marketing of the project.

#### Story
It was weekend, maybe Saturday as I remember. I was trying to find an engineer who can help me developing App called Globee and Min was wrapping up designing my logo by cutting the image and extracting the name card illustrator file. We were concentrating at what we are doing, suddenly Min told me that she want to make an app and it is very simple. She said she found many people, usually girls I guess, uses iPhone's copy & paste pop-up to hide some part of their photo, which is not wanted to be shared but at the same time they want to share the photo itself. So, her idea was simply make customizable copy & paste pop-up for user. At that time, I was planning to make other app called Sleeping Good :), which helps people who has trouble with insomnia. Anyway, I looked up whether there is any other app similar with her idea, and I found one called Sense Sticker. But the user's comments and interest about the app was not bad and since the idea looked really simple... I said "Yes, I will finish making this app in <strike>3 days</strike>". It turns out it needs <u>3 months</u>..haha :D

## Globee

#### Excerpt
- 2015/10/05
- PM, Server, Android, iOS, UX Design
- Globee is a native tutor matching service, which has similar user interface to that of Tinder. I carefully re-designed user experience of the application from the first draft of wireframe, designed database model and developed server. Chanil and I developed the Android and iOS applications for Globee.

#### Story
I've been Boston to participate a program called KIC Start Mass Challenge Program. There were over 20 startups who want to apply a worldwide startup accelerator, Mass Challenge. We were taking accelerating course for 3 weeks in Boston University Questrom School of Business. This course helped us to learn how to make a pitch, how to build up our business, successful business story and etc. For 3 weeks, we were staying at the same hotel, taking the same courses and hanging around together and we get to know each other very well. After we graduate this course and go back to Korea, Junghak who is CEO of Zumanji said he really need me to help him to build up service called Globee and he really looked desperate. I couldn't say No. Anyway the concept looked nice to me and he said he just need prototype so that he can show the app to New York investors. Turns out his team was expecting very nice and high quality app. What a liaaaaar..sighs..

## Bread

#### Excerpt
- 2015/10/04
- Android, UX Design
- Bread is a bookshelf app for you. It helps you to save books for later use or leave comments about the books. I re-designed user experience of Bread iOS application like the that of Android, which follows Google material design guideline. And I also developed Android application for Bread.

#### Story
It was over 2AM in the morning. I was coding BTTENDANCE iOS app overnight. There were 3 more people who were working in the 24 hour cafe. Somehow I got lost my concentration, and I opened up Facebook to see what other people were doing. There was a KAIST computer science group and I requested friendship to someone who I found interesting including Chanil. He accepted me so quick, sent me a message and I was surprised that he was not sleeping too. Several month later I got message from Chanil, he said he wanted to meet me and talk about startups and life. And I said yes.  
We were having a talk in cafe and found out we both applied for same government supporting program. And that day was the announcing day for the 1st candidate of the program. Result was like I made it and he didn't. It felt awkward. Anyway, I found government support is not that helpful because they requested too  many documents and also there were too many restriction and limits. So I dropped out from the programs. Chanil passed other supporting program later on.  
Since I was building business without any money support and Chanil has one. I needed some money and Chanil needed someone who can make his iOS application into Android version, so I said I will help him. Maybe I might find some interest in reading books while making a bookshelf application :)

## Bttendance

#### Excerpt
- 2015/10/03
- CEO, Server, Android, iOS, Homepage, UX Design
- BTTENDANCE is a smart teaching assistant service. It provides 3 main features: automatic attendance checking, audience response and delicate notification system. I developed back-end server, Android application, iOS application and homepage and designed user experience for BTTENDANCE.

#### Story
I was taking some boring course called Computer Organization. Actually, the course itself was fine. The professor was extremely good at English: He has degree or MS and PhD in Stanford. Maybe these building up new product things are so fun for me, other stuff like taking course, meeting friends, playing games are not fun for me anymore. Anyway, I was waiting a guy named Sanghoon, who is my partner for team project of Computer Organization for entire semester. He showed up almost 2 hour later than the time we were supposed to meet. I was definitely mad at him, but I tried to keep my composure: We just met and didn't want to go harsh with team member at first. While we were solving the first project, I found he was actually my senior at hight school and we were at the same mathematics academy when we were middle school students. Haha...what a life... The most interesting things I found from him was he has lots of business ideas. And one of them was BTTENDANCE.  
My dormitory roommate lived outside almost all of the days. I used entire room, which were for 2 students and my friends from outside KAIST asked me to use my room for a day or two because one of the bed is empty anyway. I found that there is some demands for guest house since almost all of the KAIST students are from whole country and if the friends of KAIST students want to visit, they definitely needs some place to stay. I need some testing about this. So I uploaded my dormitory room at Airbnb for $10/day. I was planning to check how many calls I get from it and cancel the booking later on. I don't know how, guessing the Airbnb sent the email, the school knew that I posted my dormitory on Airbnb in like 12 hours. The first call I got by posting my dormitory was I'm at a crisis of expulsion. Arrgggggg...I met Sanghoon and discussed about this situation. His advise was to meet the professor who is in the charge of me, which makes me another problem because I just got back to school from the military service and the professor in charge of me had been changed while I was working for military service. Which means I never met her before. Awesome! I had no choice but to meet someone I never met before and tell her that you are in the charge of me, I made a big problem here and please help me. And this is what happened. Firstly, she laughed at me. Secondly, she twitted about this. And kindly she helped me out from expulsion. Anyway I lost rest of the interests in KAIST, kicked out from dormitory, moved near Sanghoon's studio and started building up BTTENDANCE.

## Vingle

#### Excerpt
- 2015/10/02
- Android
- Vingle is an interest based social network service and it has similar features to those of Pinterest, which allow you to signup, to fetch feeds, to like or save the posts. Chansuk and I developed the Android application for Vingle from the back-end by handling network to the front-end by implementing customized graphic user interface.

#### Story
I returned to school after finishing my military duty. During the military service, I made two apps. One is called Music Off, which is successfully launched. And another is called MusiCon, which I failed to launch and decided to stop the project even though it was 95% done. After the midterm, I found school is so boring and I wrote "I want to do startup stuff." on the Facebook. Taehoon who is high senior of mine and also the CEO of Watcha, one of the most popular startup in Korea, saw my post on the Facebook. He called me and made an appointment for dinner that day. He drove from Seoul to Daejun for 90 minutes and we had a dinner and beer. He somehow persuaded me to apply a resume for his company and we mailed my resume to his company in my dormitory.  
After some hour, I thought like I should probably try to find some other startups, too. So I did and found Vingle, which looks a bit more professional and the CEO and COO already had experience in building up successful startup called Viki. I sent my resume to Vingle by myself this time. I started working for Vingle right after Christmas.  
I think I'm kind of person who want to decide my life by myself. I feel really sorry for Taehoon. So sorry T.T
