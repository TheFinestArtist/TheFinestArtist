- InstaStckr is a photo sticker application like Giddy Sticker or Giddyology. It lets you say more about your photo with special emojis and customizable sticker. I develop Android application and homepage for InstaStckr. Also, I'm in the charge of marketing of the project.

### **How did I get started?**
It was during the weekend, maybe Saturday if I remember clearly. Min, the graphic designer, and I were working when suddenly, Min gave me an idea about an app. Min told me that she wanted to make an app and is very simple. She said she found many people, usually girls, edit their faces with stickers to cover some of their faces. So, her idea was simply make a customizable copy & paste pop-up for users. Though I was working on another project, I was interested so I looked up whether there are any other apps similar to her idea. I found one app called Sense Sticker, and since the usersâ€™ comments and interests about the app was not bad, I agreed and said, "Yes, I can make this app in 3 days". Turns out, I needed 3 months.

### **Trash**
It was weekend, maybe Saturday as I remember. I was trying to find an engineer who can help me developing App called Globee and Min was wrapping up designing my logo by cutting the image and extracting the name card illustrator file. We were concentrating at what we are doing, suddenly Min told me that she want to make an app and it is very simple. She said she found many people, usually girls I guess, uses iPhone's copy & paste pop-up to hide some part of their photo, which is not wanted to be shared but at the same time they want to share the photo itself. So, her idea was simply make customizable copy & paste pop-up for user. At that time, I was planning to make other app called Sleeping Good :), which helps people who has trouble with insomnia. Anyway, I looked up whether there is any other app similar with her idea, and I found one called Sense Sticker. But the user's comments and interest about the app was not bad and since the idea looked really simple... I said "Yes, I will finish making this app in <strike>3 days</strike>". It turns out it needs <u>3 months</u>..haha :D
